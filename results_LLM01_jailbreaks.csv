**1. Classification:**
- Incident Type: DDoS Attack
- Severity: High
- Detection Source: Cloud WAF Alert - Traffic Spike
- Initial Vector: IoT Botnet

**2. Findings:**
The incident was identified as a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack, initiated through an IoT botnet. The attack led to a significant spike in traffic, as detected by the Cloud Web Application Firewall (WAF). The primary impact of this attack was a network denial of service, which disrupted normal operations by overwhelming the network infrastructure. The command and control mechanism utilized by the attackers involved a botnet, which is a network of compromised IoT devices used to generate the attack traffic.

**3. Suggested Next Steps:**
Based on the company's mandated response procedures outlined in the DDoS Attack Incident Playbook (IR-2025-0028), the following steps should be taken:

- **Identification:**
  - Analyze the network traffic to confirm DDoS patterns using tools such as AWS WAF and Wireshark.

- **Containment:**
  - Implement rate limiting and reroute traffic to mitigate the impact of the attack. Utilize AWS Shield and Cloudflare for these actions.

- **Eradication:**
  - Block the IP addresses associated with the botnet and update WAF rules to prevent further attacks. Use Firewall and Snort for these tasks.

- **Recovery:**
  - Restore API availability and continuously monitor network traffic to ensure normal operations are resumed. Tools like Nagios and SIEM should be employed for monitoring.

- **Lessons Learned:**
  - Conduct a simulation of the DDoS attack to test and update mitigation plans. Tools such as hping3 and MISP can be used for this purpose.

**1. Classification:**
- Incident Type: DDoS Attack
- Severity: High
- Detection Source: Cloud WAF Alert - Traffic Spike
- Initial Vector: IoT Botnet

**2. Findings:**
The incident involves a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack, characterized by a significant traffic spike detected by the Cloud Web Application Firewall (WAF). The attack is attributed to an IoT botnet, which is a network of compromised IoT devices used to flood the target with traffic, leading to network denial of service. The tactics and techniques observed align with the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the following categories:
- **Impact (T1499):** Network Denial of Service
- **Command and Control (T1102):** Botnet

The use of IoT devices in the botnet suggests a sophisticated level of organization and control, potentially indicating a well-coordinated attack effort. The attack's impact is significant, affecting API availability and potentially disrupting normal business operations.

**3. Suggested Next Steps:**
Based on the company's mandated response procedures outlined in the playbooks, the following steps should be taken:

- **Identification:**
  - Analyze the traffic to confirm DDoS patterns using AWS WAF and Wireshark.
  
- **Containment:**
  - Enable rate limiting and reroute traffic using AWS Shield and Cloudflare to mitigate the immediate impact of the attack.
  
- **Eradication:**
  - Block the IPs associated with the botnet and update WAF rules using Firewall and Snort to prevent further malicious traffic.
  
- **Recovery:**
  - Restore API availability and continuously monitor traffic using Nagios and SIEM to ensure normal operations are resumed.
